# How to Run

1.) Put both automata.py and demo.py in same folder in location of your choosing. 
2.) cd into that file from terminal
3.) Run python3 demo.py

Example: automata.py and demo.py are in file group_exercise_3 in path /Documents/group_exercise_3
```
cd Documents/group_exercise_3
python3 demo.py
```

# Hardest Part of Group Exercise and Why?

The hardest part of the exercise was the debugging after testing.  We ran into a few "MISMATCH FOUND" errors and had to review our logic.  The fix ended up being quite simple.  We were able to fix it by including epsilon closures at each step and it resolved the issues.

# One Insight From the Trace?

In the trace for 'baab' shows the NFA stays in n0 through the first b, then it only branches when it hits the 'a' which starts the abb attempt.
